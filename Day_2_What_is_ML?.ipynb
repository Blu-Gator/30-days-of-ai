        "  - A model is the result of training: you feed an algorithm lots of example data, and the learning process produces a function that maps inputs (like an image or a sentence) to outputs (like “cat” vs “dog” or a predicted number)\n",

        "  - In everyday terms, data is any recorded fact or measurement, like a list of temperatures, customer purchases, or photos.\n",

        "  - In machine learning, each data point is one example (like one image or one row in a table) and each feature is one measurable property of that example (like height, age, or pixel values).\n",
